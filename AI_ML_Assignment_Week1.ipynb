    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, began as an idea in the 1950s. Alan Turing asked a big question: \"Can machines think?\" This led to the famous Turing Test. In 1956, the term \"AI\" was officially born at the Dartmouth Conference. Over time, AI grew through ups and downs—from logic-based systems in the 60s, to expert systems in the 80s, and the rise of machine learning (ML) in the 90s. The 2000s brought deep learning, which made things like self-driving cars and voice assistants possible.\n",

    "AI is powerful, but it’s not perfect. It can show bias if trained on unfair data. It needs lots of personal data, raising privacy issues. And yes, it might replace some jobs. But we can reduce the risks by using fair data, keeping AI systems transparent, and helping people learn new skills.\n"
